# Yin and Yang

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Yin-and-Yang-Theme/main/assets/screenshot.png)

Welcome to the Yin and Yang Obsidian theme! This theme was created with both dark mode and light mode in mind. Hopefully, you too will enjoy the stark contrast in colors.

## Plugins to Use

- Style Settings: I've added a ton of customizable features with the theme, including the ability to change base hue and saturation 🥳.
- Hider: This will allow you to hide various elements of the Obsidian UI for a cleaner and more minimal workspace 🤗.

## How To Install

You can find Yin and Yang Obsidian's community themes browser under `Settings` > `Appearance` > `Themes`.

Alternatively, download Yin and Yang.css to .obsidian/themes in your Vault folder and activate it under `Settings` > `Appearance`. (For older versions of Obsidian that do not support themes yet, rename Yin and Yang.css to obsidian.css and place it in the root of your Vault.)
